* Colors in messages
* Note in README that there was an attempt to embed torch.jit in transforms but the process was too complicated and the documentation too little.
* Add a "Help needed" section or a "Contribute" one with 2 issues:
    - Test and report on distributed software
    - Embed torch jit as much as possible
* Add docstrings
* pip install torch-tb-profiler
* Add [Pillow SIMD](https://github.com/uploadcare/pillow-simd) to README for anyone that supports is
* Remove cuda pytorch from requirements and add it as an advice in the README
* Add Distributed using [PyTorch Distributed and Mixed Precision Tutorial](https://github.com/yangkky/distributed_tutorial/blob/master/src/mnist-mixed.py) and [PyTorch Documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html).
* Follow [NVIDIA Apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) repo instructions to install it. 
    - `git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex`
    - `cd apex`
    - `pip install -v --disable-pip-version-check --no-cache-dir ./`

# Demo

We have added some scripts for demonstration purposes. 

## Instructions

First, download the [PennFudanPed](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jshi/ped_html/PennFudanPed.zip) dataset. To get familiar with the original training script, you can examine the `demo_train.py` script. To execute the script, use:

```powershell
python demo_train.py
```

This will initiate the training sequence on the [PennFudanPed](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jshi/ped_html/PennFudanPed.zip) dataset for 20 epochs.


Then, you can test the results of the trained model. To do that, use:

```powershell
python demo_test.py
```
